## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Overview

- **Low-Level Networking**: Uses raw sockets to craft HTTP/1.1 requests manually
- **Secure Connections**: HTTPS handled via Python's `ssl` module
- **Content Display**:
  - HTML: Parsed into plain text using `html2text`
  - JSON: Nicely formatted using `json.dumps(indent=2)`
- **Caching Layer**: Response data saved in `~/.go2web_cache/` using MD5 hashes of request URLs
- **Search Engine Integration**: Extracts Bing search results with `BeautifulSoup` and CSS selectors (`li.b_algo`)
